                Century” in 1972,
                held in Reykjavik, Iceland.
                It features Soviet champion Boris Spassky (on the left) and American challenger Bobby Fischer (on the
                right) competing in the World Chess Championship.
                This event was particularly significant due to the context of the Cold War and the polarization between
                the two superpowers.</figcaption>

                    which he won with a 100% success rate, 13 victories in 13 games.
                </li>
                <li class="my-3">

                    - He had his first participation in the Candidates Tournament in Belgrade,

                <li class="my-3">
                    <time class="date">1962</time>
                    - In his second attempt at the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao, Bobby Fischer accused Soviet
                    players
                    of colluding to manipulate results.
                    Though unproven, this led to a format change, but Fischer ultimately withdrew from the tournament.
                </li>
                <li class="my-3">
                    <time class="date">1971</time>
                    - He reversed his decision, defeated Mark Taimanov, Bent Larsen, Tigran Petrosian and
                    earned the right to challenge the world champion, Boris Spassky

                <li class="my-3">
                    <time class="date">1992</time>
                    - After years in reclusion, Fischer had a rematch in Yugoslavia against Spassky,
                    which took place during international sanctions against the Milosevic government.
                    Consequently, the United States threatened to arrest him upon his return
