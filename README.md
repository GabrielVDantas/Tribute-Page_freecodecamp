## ðŸ“• Tribute Page

Welcome to my Tribute Page!

In this repository, you will find a web page dedicated to honoring Bobby Fischer, one of the greatest chess players in history

## ðŸ“• About the Project

The challenge of creating this Tribute Page is part of the certification curriculum of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and I'm excited to share it with the community. This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout the course.
